# Social_Media_App
Deployed version:
<br>
Hi,
<br>
This is a social media app I build using the MERNG stack: <br>
<li>MongoDB 
<li>Express
<li>React
<li>Node 
<li>GraphQL
<br>
<br>
I earned how to implement a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to a social media app back-end.
